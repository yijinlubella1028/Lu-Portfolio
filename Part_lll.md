# Final Project Part lll

## Improvements from Part II

Step I: Revision on data visualization based on interviews from part ll. 

1) On the “U.S. China trade Deficit Reaches the Highest Point in 2018” graph, I added the number on the top of the column because people commented that they are curious about the highest number. The number is pretty astonishing by displaying because columns from other years have a similar height.

2) On the “U.S.-China Tariff Rates Toward Each Other During the Trade War Era” graph, I changed the annotation area into red, providing a more noticeable color highlight to show the idea of retaliatory tariff between two countries.

3) On the “Countries U.S. Manufacturing Jobs has been Generated Before 2018 Tariff” chart, I deleted the legend and only kept top four countries that generated the most number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. By doing so, people could see China’s absolute advantages for generating jobs for U.S. employment. 

4) I changed the bubble graph to a square chart on the “U.S. Companies in China Changing Business Strategy due to the Tariff” graph. One of the reasons for doing so is because the square chart can highlight the choice of “delaying or canceling investment decision” with the greater area. On the other hand, a square graph provides a visual sense of pulling everything together, which corresponds to the idea of offering a survey to U.S. companies that have collaborated or plan to collaborate with Chinese businesses.

5) On the “Value of Chinese Investment in the U.S.” graph, I revised by highlighting the highest and the lowest column because I discussed the difference between the two extremes in the text. It is helpful to show the extremely low and the difference between the two years.

6) For the loss on both sides, I added a chart showing the “sudden decrease in imports from China impact economies”. The sudden decrease in imports from China is evident on the graph, and it is helpful for me to illustrate the idea of decreasing welfare in both countries.

7) Last but not least, I added a chart for Trade War Implications. The first implication is “imposing tariff cannot solve the trade deficit”. I highlighted four recent years on the bar graph, which are all similar to the years before the trade war. The visualization promotes the idea illustration, and it is intuitive for the audience to understand the context.

Step ll: Revise the data story

1) Add data and facts to support my idea illustration in sections 

2) Add a final section of trade war implications to strengthen the call to action.

Step lll: Put draft into shorthand, and furnish it into a presentation.

Step IV: Research for copyright-free images from CMU library 

Step V: Write the Speech, and shorten it to 1 minute.
1) First Version

The purpose of this presentation is to allow policy students to understand the impacts of the Trade War on both U.S. and Chinese economies.

As we all know, the U.S. - China has established a mutually beneficial relationship since the 1980s. It is so-called Pingpong diplomacy. The friendly lasted for a long time until the Trade War broke out in 2018. The main reason for the Trade War is the highest trade deficit between the two countries in 2018. The conflict is escalated by retaliatory tariff imposition made by both countries' administrations. The tariff eventually reaches an all-time high at 22% on the China side and 21% on the U.S. side.

The impact could be analyzed from three perspectives. The first one is declining U.S. employment opportunities. Since China contributes to over 50% of manufacturing job opportunities in the U.S. from trade, the sudden abrupt trade relation caused the loss of chances in the job market.

Second, the impact on U.S. companies' strategies in China indicates that over 31% believe that they should delay or cancel investment decisions in China. Thus, because U.S. companies diminished interest in Chia, Chinese companies started to see the U.S. market for fewer collaboration opportunities. Eventually, the Chinese direct investment in the U.S. reached the lowest point in 2018 since 2010. It is continually decreasing.

Trade war is the loss on both sides. Due to the decrease in Chinese exports to U.S. and U.S. imports from China, China decreased welfare by 1.9% and the U.S. by 0.3%. What should the two countries do next? First, both administrations should understand that imposing the tariff cannot solve the trade deficit. Second, the conflict between two countries is not only on the economic dimension but also on political, cultural, and military factors. Thus, the tension could not dissipate in the short term. However, under the current covid environment, two superpowers have the ability and chances to collaborate on an international basis, promoting world peace by helping other countries in need.

2) Final Version

The purpose of this presentation is to allow policy students to understand the impacts of the Trade War on both U.S. and Chinese economies.

The main reason for the Trade War is the highest trade deficit between the two countries in 2018. The conflict is escalated by retaliatory tariff made by both countries' administrations.

One of the most influential impact would be on companies in both U.S. and China. Over 31% U.S. companies believe that they should delay or cancel investment decisions in China. In return, Chinese companies perceived the U.S. market for fewer collaboration opportunities, decreasing its investment to the U.S.

What is the next step for two countries? Both administrations should understand that imposing the tariff cannot solve the trade deficit. On the other hand, Under the current covid environment, two superpowers have the ability and chances to collaborate on an international basis, promoting world peace by helping other countries in need.

## Learning from the whole process
First, I identified my audience as policy students, and I hope my visualization is intuitive enough that the general public could also understand my context. I did not put too Many academic references or use nomenclatures in my wording to achieve this. Instead, I use colloquial language and intuitive data figures to illustrate my point. On the other hand, I believe my interviews and understanding of the context help me identify the audience. For example, the topic is pretty hot occurred between U.S. and China. I am a Chinese student, and I feel related to this topic and hope my classmates could understand the concept and my perspectives, as a Chinese student, on the U.S.- China Trade War. Major adjustments on data visualization for catering to the audience include but are not limited to adding two intuitive charts to show the result of the tariff escalation on two countries and highlight major elements on the chart to enhance the aesthetics and intuitiveness. 

While I was doing this project, I gained a thorough understanding of using data visualization to support ideas. In the meantime, I am becoming more confident in my practical skills for visualization data and conveying ideas to the targeted audience.
