# Lu-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! I am Bella Lu (she/her/hers). I love to convince people with evidence-based analysis. To accomplish this, I focus on enriching perspectives, strengthening analytical skills, and always challenging myself for innovative thinking.

I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing my masterâ€™s in public policy management. I have a strong research background in industry/company research and policy analysis. Also, I have a good command of data analysis tools, including SQL, Python, R, Stata, SAS, Excel, and Access. 

Last semester, I worked in the Machine Learning Department at CMU for an AI testing project. From my experience, I am exploring opportunities for AI application in areas including but not limited to modeling social behaviors and economic development. With a broad skillset covering important facets in data analytics and problem-solving, I am looking for exciting opportunities to strengthen my analytical and problem-solving skills.

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn how to tell intriguing data stories to my clients at work. Specifically, how to use tools to draw data on charts, use proper language to convey the meaning of the data, and do research and find significant data evidence to support my arguments. I want to be a project manager in the future, so that generalization skills and self-critique skills are quite important for me. From this class, I am looking forward to learning various critique methodologies on data visualization to justify my own design decisions and recommendations.
