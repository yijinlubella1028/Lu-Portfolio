# Part II Government Debt-to-GDP ratio on Flourish
Comment: I did not change much from the professor's instructions. I choose to show the year on the x-axis of all countries' charts. However, I found that the end dot is not connecting to the line's end point. I suggest that the instruction requires us to provide data visualization from 1995 to 2019, but the data is actually from 1995 to 2020. Thus, there is a disconnection between the line and the end dot.
