# Part II Government Debt-to-GDP ratio on Flourish
Comment: I did not change much from the professor's instructions. I choose to show the year on the x-axis of all countries' charts. However, I found that the end dot is not connecting to the line's end point. I suggest that the instruction requires us to provide data visualization from 1995 to 2019, but the data is actually from 1995 to 2020. Thus, there is a disconnection between the line and the end dot.

# Part II Debt-to-GDP ratio Before and After Financial Crisis on Flourish
I select a column chart to show how the Debt-to-GDP ratio changes in different countries from 1995 to 2019. Unlike the previous chart, the intended audience for this visualization would be government officials who care about how Debt-to-GDP reacted before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Readers could see a highlighted axis in 2008 and make a trend comparison before 2008 and after 2008 on the Debt-to-GDP ratio. At the same time, the added filter option allows readers to change among countries. They can see how other countries perform and compare to their trend change. Moreover, the label for the axis remains the same: the x-axis represents the time from 1995 to 2019, and the y-axis represents the Debt-to-GDP ratio. The title clearly states the chart's purpose, which is "Debt-to-GDP ratio Before and After Financial Crisis."

In terms of color choice, I greyed columns for years other than 2008 while highlighting 2008 in blue because I would love to convey a clear message that 2008 is a turning point in the financial field. On the other hand, I put a select number on top of the column. By doing so, the number would not overlap while readers could see the amount reading of the column.
