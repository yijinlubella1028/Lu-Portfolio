# U.S.-China Trade War Impacts Economies on Both Sides

## Summary
Since the Trump administration initiated the Trade War between U.S. and China, the U.S. has increased tariffs on China imports, and thus both U.S. exports and imports with China have decreased a lot. The Trade War strikes the collaborative relationship between the two countries and dramatically impacts the U.S.'s trade structure. In this project, I am interested in exploring the trade shift between the U.S. and China before and after the Trade War, including the change in exports and imports, trade partners, and categories of goods and services.

## Call to Action
Despite an informative review on the change of U.S.-China trade relations, I would love to emphasize the significance of this project - to understand the negative impacts on both U.S. and China's economies and call government agencies for immediate actions to stop the meaningless increase trade barriers between two countries. The Intended audience for the data visualization is the government agency. In addition, I hope that my graph is intuitive enough that policy students and the general public can understand the impact on both countries.

The Ping-Pong Diplomacy between U.S. and China has been smoothly developed since the 1970s from aspects of the economy, cultural exchange, trade, and international affairs. Though there are some scratches on the different standpoints of political issues and global dominance, both sides remain in a peaceful relationship until 2018. However, the turning point for U.S. and China trade relations was that the Trump administration assumed that the U.S. Trade Deficit - which occurred when a country imports more than its exports - was inherently evil, and China was to blame. Thus, Washington initiated a series of tariffs on China's exports to protect its domestic suppliers and generate revenue from tariffs.

### Trade Deficit
The trade imbalance exist between U.S. and China has been considered as the main reason for the trade war. In 2018, the trade deficit between U.S. exports and U.S. imports from China reaches the highest point since 2015, and it is still considered as the highest deficit until now.

## Conflict: Raising Tariff during the Trade War 
The red line indicates China's tariff on U.S. exports, while the Blue line indicates the U.S. tariff on China's exports. It is noticeable that during the trade war era. Two countries have increased tariffs steeply. They seem to impose tariff orders simultaneously and one tariff after the other. Finally, the rate reaches an all-time high at 22% for China's tariff on U.S. exports and 21% on U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. What is the result when two countries impose on each other's exports?

## Impact on U.S. employment
This statistic shows the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs that were restored to the United States from 2010 to 2018 by the country they were reshored from. For 2010 to 2018, 64,252 manufacturing jobs came from companies moving their business operations back from China to the United States. From the visualization, China, as a trade partner of U.S., generated the most job for the U.S. from 2010 to 2018. It is over half of the total jobs generated from the trade. However, because of the increasing trade barrier between U.S. and China, trade becomes costly for businesses on both sides and thus could potentially harm the U.S. job market.

## Impact on U.S. companies' strategies in China
This statistic shows the results of a survey conducted among American companies in China on the perceived impact on their businesses of the U.S.-China trade tariffs as of September 2018. Not surprisingly, During the survey period, 31.1 percent of the surveyed American companies in China said that due to the U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs they delayed or canceled investment decisions. On one hand, U.S. Comapnies lost great opportunities in Chinese market. On the other hand, China lost foreign investment from U.S. companies.

## Impact on Chinese Direct Investment to U.S.
This statistic shows the value of Chinese direct investments in the United States from 2009 to 2019. 2019, the first year after the Trade War, Chinese direct investments in the United States amounted to approximately 4.78 billion U.S. dollars, the lowest annual investment since 2010. As I discussed above, the Trade War negatively impacted both sides' businesses.

## Resolution 
"More Pain Than Gain" - Trade War hurts both sides
The trade war caused economic pain on both sides and led to diversion of trade flows away from both China and the United States. 
- As described by Heather Long at the Washington Post, “U.S. economic growth slowed, business investment froze, and companies didn’t hire as many people. Across the nation, a lot of farmers went bankrupt, and the manufacturing and freight transportation sectors have hit lows not seen since the last recession. Trump’s actions amounted to one of the largest tax increases in years.” (Brookings)

For U.S.
- The trade deficit is not remarkly reduced after the trade war.
- U.S. companies lost at least $1.7 trillion in the price of their stocks as a result of U.S. tariffs imposed on imports from China.
- The trade war had already cost the U.S. economy nearly 300,000 jobs and an estimated 0.3% of real GDP by 2021.

For China
- Chinese firms have recently started absorbing part of the costs of the tariffs by reducing the prices of their exports.
- US tariffs caused a 25% export loss, inflicting a US$35 billion blow to Chinese exports in the US market for tariffed goods in the first half of 2019.

## User Research
### Interview Script
I design the interview script from aspects of aesthetics, intuitiveness, logical coherence and persuasion effectiveness.

*Aesthetics & Intuitiveness*

1) What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the story?
2) What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color? Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story?
3) What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved?

*Logical Coherence & Persuasion Effectiveness*

1) Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? If not, what could be improved in the visualizations?
2) Is there sufficient evidence presented here to support this main point? If not, What additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?

*Overall Feedback*
1) Do you feel like you’ve learned something from this?
2) Do you have any final thoughts or suggestions that weren’t already covered in the previous questions?

### Answer
I interviewed 2 policy students and 1 business students. One is from China and the other two is from the U.S. All of them are around age 25, and have a strong interest in international politics.

Q1
- A: I like your story flow, and I think it is pretty intuitive to understand 
- B: It is a great story. I did not notice that Chinese investment in the U.S. has decreased a lot after the Trade War.
- C: I think the story is logical, but I would recommend you work more on the call to the action part. I think the call to action is not strong enough. Do you have any actionable plan for that?

Q2
- A: I found the second to the last graph pretty distracting. What is the point of putting the number there? I suggest you remove the number and enlarge the circle you want to talk about.
- B: It would be better to remove your legend from the pie chart.
- C: Overall, I think it is excellent to use color. When you put your presentation in shorthand, you want to ensure the consistency of the paint.

Q3
- A: No
- B: As I said before, I suggest you remove the legend in the pie chart. I think they are pretty distracting.
- C: No.

Q4
- A, B: Visualization is pretty clear on what it is showing.
- C: I would recommend you put a chart for the call to the action part. Since the resolution part is full of words, it would be better to see a projection on U.S.-China relations when your recommended policy is implemented.

Q5
- A: I think information is limited for expansion due to 1 minute presentation time. I would recommend you to expand on the call to the action part and maybe relate to the cause of the trade war at the beginning. 
- B: I think you are given a comprehensive review. 
- C: Evidence is sufficiently provided

Q6 Q7
- A: Definitely, I learned from your story. I found it surprising to quantify the negative impacts of the trade war on the U.S. and China. Nice job.
- B: Thanks for sharing this. I love how your story flows to the end. 
- C: My final thought would be more engaging to the audience. I think your story is logically constructed, and the evidence is sufficient, but I think you need to use your graph to communicate more to the audience. For instance, you can ask some questions while you are presenting or make contrast between the audience’s expectation and the reality. Overall, excellent job!
