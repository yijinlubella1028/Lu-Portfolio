# U.S.-China Trade War Impacts Businesses on Both Sides

## Summary
Since the Trump administration initiated the Trade War between U.S. and China, the U.S. has increased tariffs on China imports, and thus both U.S. exports and imports with China have decreased a lot. The Trade War strikes the collaborative relationship between the two countries and dramatically impacts the U.S.'s trade structure. In this project, I am interested in exploring the trade shift between the U.S. and China before and after the Trade War, including the change in exports and imports, trade partners, and categories of goods and services.

## Call to Action
Despite an informative review on the change of U.S.-China trade relations, I would love to emphasize the significance of this project - to understand the negative impacts on both U.S. and China's economies and call government agencies for immediate actions to stop the meaningless increase trade barriers between two countries. The Intended audience for the data visualization is the government agency. In addition, I hope that my graph is intuitive enough that policy students and the general public can understand the impact on both countries.

The Ping-Pong Diplomacy between U.S. and China has been smoothly developed since the 1970s from aspects of the economy, cultural exchange, trade, and international affairs. Though there are some scratches on the different standpoints of political issues and global dominance, both sides remain in a peaceful relationship until 2018. However, the turning point for U.S. and China trade relations was that the Trump administration assumed that the U.S. Trade Deficit - which occurred when a country imports more than its exports - was inherently evil, and China was to blame. Thus, Washington initiated a series of tariffs on China's exports to protect its domestic suppliers and generate revenue from tariffs.

### Trade Deficit
The trade imbalance exist between U.S. and China has been considered as the main reason for the trade war. In 2018, the trade deficit between U.S. exports and U.S. imports from China reaches the highest point since 2015, and it is still considered as the highest deficit until now.

The red line indicates China's tariff on U.S. exports, while the Blue line indicates the U.S. tariff on China's exports. It is noticeable that during the trade war era. Two countries have increased tariffs steeply. They seem to impose tariff orders simultaneously and one tariff after the other. Finally, the rate reaches an all-time high at 22% for China's tariff on U.S. exports and 21% on U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. What is the result when two countries impose on each other's exports?

## Impact on U.S.companies' strategies in China
This statistic shows the results of a survey conducted among American companies in China on the perceived impact on their businesses of the U.S.-China trade tariffs as of September 2018. Not surprisingly, During the survey period, 31.1 percent of the surveyed American companies in China said that due to the U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs they delayed or canceled investment decisions. On one hand, U.S. Comapnies lost great opportunities in Chinese market. On the other hand, China lost foreign investment from U.S. companies.
