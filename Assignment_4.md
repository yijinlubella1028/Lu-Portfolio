# Assignment 4
## Data Source Description
The omicron outbreak brings up many critiques on states’ responsibilities for Covid-19 containment; thus, I am curious about the containment progress each state completed when they decide to reopen the economy. To access the data used to create the visualization below, I visited several websites on “Covid-19 States Control”. I found an interesting data visualization from vox.com, which should explain how much progress states have made toward containing the coronavirus and keeping the Covid contained by following five essential criteria instructed by the CDC. The main dataset for visualization is from CDC Covid Tracking Project, and the other two complementary datasets for testing the accuracy of context information are from US Department of Health and Service 
and Census Bureau. Source information is in the reference below.

## Wireframe a Solution
In the previous critique assignment, I insisted on understanding the importance of five criteria from states' performances on covid containment and enhancing the readers' engagement by bringing in more information. However, I started to question my decision when I saw my wireframed solution. I doubt whether the audience wants to learn so much information while reading a narrative post online. The first graph should summarize and foreshow the evidence provided in the following context. It should highlight anything significant for catching readers' attention and induce them to keep reading. I have many doubts about my wireframed solution, but it is crafted based on my critique. Thus, I interviewed my friends to test out my thoughts and concerns.

## Test the Solution
### Script and Answers
### Can you tell me what you think this is? 
A: I think this graph discusses states' government policy practice for re-opening the economy after Covid containment. I can see none of the states complete all five criteria, while when is this chart drawn?

B: Wow, it's a big graph. Let me take a look. I assume that this graph talks about re-opening policy and how each state performs? Your graph's main idea is clear, but there is over-whelmed information. You may need to think of highlighting some important information.
### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
A: As I said in the previous question, I think this graph tells me the states' performances of government policy.

B: This chart tries to tell me the progress each state made for re-opening the economy. 
### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
A: I am an international student, unfamiliar with the state's abbreviation. Can you tell me how Pennsylvania performs in this? Also, it is surprising to see that New Jersey and New York perform well in meeting the criteria for re-opening the economy. I heard that NJ and NY suffered a lot from the Covid-19 outbreak.

B: I understand this is your scratch, but I am confused about your handwriting and what you mean by "significance of goal #1". As I learned from your context description, the following narrative discusses the meaning of each criterion and why they are essential. Do you think you must put them ahead in this "summary" chart (first chart)? Additionally, I am confused with your scale. I know that most states only complete one to two criteria, but from your scale for the y-axis, I am not sure whether you correctly do this.
### Who do you think is the intended audience for this? 
A: Anyone can understand this graph. I assume the audience should be the general public who cares about how states meet five criteria for re-opening the economy.

B: Public Audience.
### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
A: I think this might be a handwritten thing. I would love to point out your title and subtitle. I can't see them. Also, I would suggest you write as you describe for five goals. The current description on your graph is vague.

B: I can see the meaning of your color, but is there any special meaning for using the blue tone? When you relate the color blue to policy, I can't stop myself thinking about the democratic party.
### Compared to the original graph, which one looks better to you? 
A: I like the previous graph. I think there are too many things in your wire-framed version. I know you are trying to incorporate more information in your chart, but this chart is in a narrative, and the purpose of this chart should be helping readers to understand the context. However, the original graph also has flaws. For instance, it is unclear on the level of progress in the legend, and the color is pretty ugly. I would recommend you find one important message and highlight it. This could catch readers' attention and intrigue them to find out in the following text.

B: I like your graph. I see you pay attention to details. It is a pretty informative graph, and I believe it will look better if you use software to finish. However, I wonder whether the bar chart is your best chart selection. I would recommend you use a heat map showing the progress made by states.

### Summary
To summarize the interview, both interviewees talk about handwriting, making it hard to read the title and subtitle. In addition, I found my wire-framed chart is hard to depict via software. Thus, I need to think about changing the type of my chart. In terms of the context, one of them mentions the unnecessary for putting too much information in the first chart, but emphasizing one crucial message and letting readers think and explore from following text and diagrams. I agree with this point, and thus I decide to use a pie chart emphasizing the progress of meeting criteria. Specifically, I would love to use percentage to show - how much percent of states meet the 5/5 criterion, how much percent of states meet the 4/5 criterion, and so on. Additionally, by changing the type of the chart, students are no longer confused about the states' abbreviation because they focus on the progress states made as a whole. However, to compensate the information for each state's progress, I will add another map with transitional (heat map) on the side, comparing among states.

## Reflection
The redesigned data visualization incorporates two wanted changes in the critique section: completeness and engagement. The revised chart brings more information on how each state responds to five criteria for re-opening the economy and intrigues readers to think why over 70% of states only comply with 0-2 criteria. Even though my revised chart is done differently from my wire-framed one, it takes the advice from the interview into consideration. It improves on focusing on one important message, catching readers' attention at the first eyesight. In addition, I put the date on my title to specify when the analysis is done. Overall, the revised chart contains two parts. The first part is a map that readers can drag the cursor to see states' performance in terms of how many criteria is complete, and thus its progress toward qualified re-opening. Map also contains a filter that allows readers to see how each state performs for different criteria. The color is purple/blue-based. Darker the color, severer the sit-in, and minor criterion qualified. On the other hand, a pie chart shows states' progress as a whole, resonating with the idea that most states do not do enough to meet the criteria.
