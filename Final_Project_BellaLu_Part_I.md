# Part I 

## Summary 
Since the Trump administration initiated the Trade War between U.S. and China, the U.S. has increased tariffs on China imports, and thus both U.S. exports and imports with China have decreased a lot. The Trade War strikes the collaborative relationship between the two countries and dramatically impacts the U.S.'s trade structure. In this project, I am interested in exploring the trade shift between the U.S. and China before and after the Trade War, including the change in exports and imports, trade partners, and categories of goods and services.

## Major Elements
*Setup*
- Increasing trend of net exports between U.S. and China since 21st century.
- Importance of China as U.S. Trade Partner: U.S. top 5 trade partners comparison in respective to net exports.

*Conflict*
- Increasing deficit of trade since the phase I of the Trade War. 
- U.S. - China trade in percentage of U.S. Trade Total before and after the Trade War 

*Resolution*
- To remedy lost net exports with China, U.S. has to seek imports elsewhere - Show the cost of finding a new trade partner.
- Chinese and US negotiators agreed to hit the pause button on their trade war on October 11, 2019, confirming that impending US tariff increases on China would not take effect as both sides make progress towards an agreement.

*Main Idea*
- The trade dependence of the U.S. on China has become much greater than China’s dependence on the U.S. It indicates that China has more flexibility in changing the trading allies in case of further escalation of the Trade war. As a result, the accumulation of long-term China-U.S. trade issues will hinder the optimization of global trade.

## Data Source
1) U.S. - China exports and imports data from 2000 to 2020. From there, I could calculate the evolution of net exports between the U.S. and China. Also, the Trade balance and the trade deficits throughout the years. The dataset is obtained from the publicly accessible website - U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade. The datasets can be explored from my repository. 

2) U.S. - China trade tariff change. I am still looking for this one. 

3) U.S. trade partners. The dataset is the same from the first source. However, it aims to demonstrate China's significance in U.S. trade and how China's significance shift to other countries after the Trade War. 

## Methods and Medium 
I plan to use Excel/python to clean the data, filtering out useful information. Additionally, I plan to use Flourish and R to do the data visualizaiton. For the final presentation, I will use shorthand to communicate my data viz.
