# Assignment 3
## Data Source Description
The omicron outbreak brings up many critiques on states’ responsibilities for Covid-19 containment; thus, I am curious about the containment progress each state completed when they decide to reopen the economy. To access the data used to create the visualization below, I visited several websites on “Covid-19 States Control”. I found an interesting data visualization from vox.com, which should explain how much progress states have made toward containing the coronavirus and keeping the Covid contained by following five essential criteria instructed by the CDC. The main dataset for visualization is from CDC Covid Tracking Project, and the other two complementary datasets for testing the accuracy of context information are from US Department of Health and Service 
and Census Bureau. Source information is in the reference below. Meanwhile, the dataset is uploaded to my GitHub page if you are interested in examining the data yourself.

## Critique the visualization 
### 1)Usefulness (Score = 8)
The audience behind the visualization should be the public audience curious about how states perform under CDC Covid controls. Since the nature of the article is shared online and it is a narrative discussing the federal instructions, the visualization should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. Indeed, the information from this visualization is useful. It helps readers see the performance level of each state and contrasts with color to compare the performance of all states in the United States.

### 2) Completeness (Score = 6)
The visualization could be improved on completeness. The context emphasizes the importance of five basic criteria states should meet before re-opening, but only four states complete four out of five criteria. To my understanding, it is not providing the “intended level of understanding” (Few, 2017). To compromise the context, It would be better if the visualization could draw significance on types of criteria completed by states and compare the completeness of Covid-control among states. 

### 3) Perceptibility (Score = 5)
From my perspective, I think readers could understand the information that the designer was trying to convey. Still, it takes a fair amount of effort to understand the meaning of color contrast and resonate the graph to the context. For instance, the narrative intends to compare the performance of states in Covid control, but the state with a larger size will display greater importance perceptually. In this sense, the map visualization would not be appropriate because it does not properly convey the information.

On the other hand, the color contrast is abrupt. I could see little transitional meaning from blue to orange to red, even though these colors indicate the increasing amount of progress each state made in front of the covid control. At the same time, the title states “most states haven’t done enough to contain covid-19”. Under this context, I believe the designer should grey out useless information from the visualization. Therefore, the graph could be improved on the selection of color and completeness in terms of context.

### 4) Truthfulness (Score = 9)
I would give the visualization a 9 on this metric, as it does appear that the visualization is accurate and reliable from the data and description in the text. Additionally, the data is from CDC, which is a valid data source.

### 5) Intuitiveness (Score = 8)
I would give the visualization a eight on this metric. As we discussed in the previous graph, the intended audience is the general public; the form of display is a United States Map which is easy for them to relate to the context of state controls of Covid in the United States. However, a few improvements can be made on selecting the color and connecting it to the context. 

### 6) Aesthetics (Score = 7) 
The visualization is pleasing to the eye but not beautiful enough. It makes use of color very sparingly, but I think perhaps a more muted/transitional color could have been used to display the significance of the data. In the meantime, the title and subtitle is centered in the middle, which is correct but could be more good-looking if it is aligned to the left. Moreover, the legend on the right corner covers part of the map. It could be moved down or moved to the upper left to ensure the completeness of the visualization. 

### 7) Engagement ( Score = 5)
Though the visualization accompanies the flow of the context (there are several similar visualizations provided in later context), it does not allow readers to examine the information. I believe that visualization is too simple that readers can only see and compare each state's progress from the graph. To enhance the engagement, I believe that the designer should provide more information and intriguing readers to think and reflect from the visualization. 


### Question 1 
#### Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently? 
The data visualization is a United States map. My first impression is on aesthetics, the poor selection of color, and the need for more information on understanding the graph. In terms of information, I found that states colored in blue stood out for me because blue is a cool tone, and only a few blocks (states) are colored in blue. I want to explore why these states are colored in blue. On the other hand, I believe that the title works pretty well. The context in the subject is quite intuitive, which tells the reader the purpose of the visualization. After carefully reading the text, I found that the visualization could be improved on the completeness of information by changing the form of display and readers' engagement by providing more information from the graph.

### Question 2
#### Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?
The audience behind the visualization should be the public audience curious about how states perform under CDC Covid controls. Since the nature of the article is shared online and it is a commentary post, the visualization should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. 

### Question 3
#### Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *
Overall, I would give this visualization a seven. I think all measures are captured here. I would add more information to the graph, change the color selection, the title and subtitle format, and the type of display, which I intended to change into a segmental bar graph measuring five metrics completed by each state. 

## Wireframe a Solution
In the previous critique section, I insisted on understanding the importance of five criteria from states' performances on covid containment and enhancing the readers' engagement by bringing in more information. However, I started to question my decision when I saw my wireframed solution. I doubt whether the audience wants to learn so much information while reading a narrative post online. The first graph should summarize and foreshow the evidence provided in the following context. It should highlight anything significant for catching readers' attention and induce them to keep reading. I have many doubts about my wireframed solution, but it is crafted based on my critique. Thus, I interviewed my friends to test out my thoughts and concerns.
