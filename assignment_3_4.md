# Assignment 3
## Data Source Description
The omicron outbreak brings up many critiques on states’ responsibilities for Covid-19 containment; thus, I am curious about the containment progress each state completed when they decide to reopen the economy. To access the data used to create the visualization below, I visited several websites on “Covid-19 States Control”. I found an interesting data visualization from vox.com, which should explain how much progress states have made toward containing the coronavirus and keeping the Covid contained by following five essential criteria instructed by the CDC. The main dataset for visualization is from CDC Covid Tracking Project, and the other two complementary datasets for testing the accuracy of context information are from US Department of Health and Service 
and Census Bureau. Source information is in the reference below. Meanwhile, the dataset is uploaded to my GitHub page if you are interested in examining the data yourself.

## Critique the visualization 
### 1)Usefulness (Score = 8)
The audience behind the visualization should be the public audience curious about how states perform under CDC Covid controls. Since the nature of the article is shared online and it is a narrative discussing the federal instructions, the visualization should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. Indeed, the information from this visualization is useful. It helps readers see the performance level of each state and contrasts with color to compare the performance of all states in the United States.

### 2) Completeness (Score = 6)
The visualization could be improved on completeness. The context emphasizes the importance of five basic criteria states should meet before re-opening, but only four states complete four out of five criteria. To my understanding, it is not providing the “intended level of understanding” (Few, 2017). To compromise the context, It would be better if the visualization could draw significance on types of criteria completed by states and compare the completeness of Covid-control among states. Additionally, the legend of the graph only displays three criteria - "little progress, some progress and strong progess". The information is vague, and readers fail to capture the meaning of the legend.

### 3) Perceptibility (Score = 5)
From my perspective, I think readers could understand the information that the designer was trying to convey. Still, it takes a fair amount of effort to understand the meaning of color contrast and resonate the graph to the context. For instance, the narrative intends to compare the performance of states in Covid control, but the state with a larger size will display greater importance perceptually. In this sense, the map visualization would not be appropriate because it does not properly convey the information.

On the other hand, the color contrast is abrupt. I could see little transitional meaning from blue to orange to red, even though these colors indicate the increasing amount of progress each state made in front of the covid control. At the same time, the title states “most states haven’t done enough to contain covid-19”. Under this context, I believe the designer should grey out useless information from the visualization. Therefore, the graph could be improved on the selection of color and completeness in terms of context.

### 4) Truthfulness (Score = 9)
I would give the visualization a 9 on this metric, as it does appear that the visualization is accurate and reliable from the data and description in the text. Additionally, the data is from CDC, which is a valid data source.

### 5) Intuitiveness (Score = 8)
I would give the visualization a eight on this metric. As we discussed in the previous graph, the intended audience is the general public; the form of display is a United States Map which is easy for them to relate to the context of state controls of Covid in the United States. However, a few improvements can be made on selecting the color and connecting it to the context. 

### 6) Aesthetics (Score = 7) 
The visualization is pleasing to the eye but not beautiful enough. It makes use of color very sparingly, but I think perhaps a more muted/transitional color could have been used to display the significance of the data. In the meantime, the title and subtitle is centered in the middle, which is correct but could be more good-looking if it is aligned to the left. Moreover, the legend on the right corner covers part of the map. It could be moved down or moved to the upper left to ensure the completeness of the visualization. 

### 7) Engagement ( Score = 5)
Though the visualization accompanies the flow of the context (there are several similar visualizations provided in later context), it does not allow readers to examine the information. I believe that visualization is too simple that readers can only see and compare each state's progress from the graph. To enhance the engagement, I believe that the designer should provide more information and intriguing readers to think and reflect from the visualization. 


### Question 1 
#### Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently? 
The data visualization is a United States map. My first impression is on aesthetics, the poor selection of color, and the need for more information on understanding the graph. In terms of information, I found that states colored in blue stood out for me because blue is a cool tone, and only a few blocks (states) are colored in blue. I want to explore why these states are colored in blue. On the other hand, I believe that the title works pretty well. The context in the subject is quite intuitive, which tells the reader the purpose of the visualization. After carefully reading the text, I found that the visualization could be improved on the completeness of information by changing the form of display and readers' engagement by providing more information from the graph.

### Question 2
#### Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?
The audience behind the visualization should be the public audience curious about how states perform under CDC Covid controls. Since the nature of the article is shared online and it is a commentary post, the visualization should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. 

### Question 3
#### Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *
Overall, I would give this visualization a seven. I think all measures are captured here. I would add more information to the graph, change the color selection, the title and subtitle format, and the type of display, which I intended to change into a segmental bar graph measuring five metrics completed by each state. 

## Wireframe a Solution
In the previous critique section, I insisted on understanding the importance of five criteria from states' performances on covid containment and enhancing the readers' engagement by bringing in more information. However, I started to question my decision when I saw my wireframed solution. I doubt whether the audience wants to learn so much information while reading a narrative post online. The first graph should summarize and foreshow the evidence provided in the following context. It should highlight anything significant for catching readers' attention and induce them to keep reading. I have many doubts about my wireframed solution, but it is crafted based on my critique. Thus, I interviewed my friends to test out my thoughts and concerns.

## Test the Solution
### Script and Answers
### Can you tell me what you think this is? 
A: I think this graph discusses states' government policy practice for re-opening the economy after Covid containment. I can see none of the states complete all five criteria, while when is this chart drawn?

B: Wow, it's a big graph. Let me take a look. I assume that this graph talks about re-opening policy and how each state performs? Your graph's main idea is clear, but there is over-whelmed information. You may need to think of highlighting some important information.
### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
A: As I said in the previous question, I think this graph tells me the states' performances of government policy.

B: This chart tries to tell me the progress each state made for re-opening the economy. 
### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
A: I am an international student, unfamiliar with the state's abbreviation. Can you tell me how Pennsylvania performs in this? Also, it is surprising to see that New Jersey and New York perform well in meeting the criteria for re-opening the economy. I heard that NJ and NY suffered a lot from the Covid-19 outbreak.

B: I understand this is your scratch, but I am confused about your handwriting and what you mean by "significance of goal #1". As I learned from your context description, the following narrative discusses the meaning of each criterion and why they are essential. Do you think you must put them ahead in this "summary" chart (first chart)? Additionally, I am confused with your scale. I know that most states only complete one to two criteria, but from your scale for the y-axis, I am not sure whether you correctly do this.
### Who do you think is the intended audience for this? 
A: Anyone can understand this graph. I assume the audience should be the general public who cares about how states meet five criteria for re-opening the economy.

B: Public Audience.
### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
A: I think this might be a handwritten thing. I would love to point out your title and subtitle. I can't see them. Also, I would suggest you write as you describe for five goals. The current description on your graph is vague.

B: I can see the meaning of your color, but is there any special meaning for using the blue tone? When you relate the color blue to policy, I can't stop myself thinking about the democratic party.
### Compared to the original graph, which one looks better to you? 
A: I like the previous graph. I think there are too many things in your wire-framed version. I know you are trying to incorporate more information in your chart, but this chart is in a narrative, and the purpose of this chart should be helping readers to understand the context. However, the original graph also has flaws. For instance, it is unclear on the level of progress in the legend, and the color is pretty ugly. I would recommend you find one important message and highlight it. This could catch readers' attention and intrigue them to find out in the following text.

B: I like your graph. I see you pay attention to details. It is a pretty informative graph, and I believe it will look better if you use software to finish. However, I wonder whether the bar chart is your best chart selection. I would recommend you use a heat map showing the progress made by states.

### Summary
To summarize the interview, both interviewees talk about handwriting, making it hard to read the title and subtitle. In addition, I found my wire-framed chart is hard to depict via software. Thus, I need to think about changing the type of my chart. In terms of the context, one of them mentions the unnecessary for putting too much information in the first chart, but emphasizing one crucial message and letting readers think and explore from following text and diagrams. I agree with this point, and thus I decide to use a pie chart emphasizing the progress of meeting criteria states. Specifically, I would love to use percentage to show - how much percent of states meet the 5/5 criterion, how much percent of states meet the 4/5 criterion, and so on. Additionally, by changing the type of the chart, students are no longer confused about the states' abbreviation because they focus on the progress states made as a whole. However, to compensate the information for each state's progress, I will add another heat map on the side, comparing among states.
